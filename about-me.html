    <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
    <p>I've always loved learning how things work, and in turn creating or
        fixing them. That's what drew me to become interested in cars; there are
        so many intricate systems that work together to make a vehicle go! My
        favourite aspect of working on vehicles has always been diagnosing and repairing
        them. I like taking things apart and making them better than when they were initially
        brought to me. Throughout my time working on vehicles, my ferver for learning has never stopped.
        In fact, it's brought me here; learning how to code. I want to be able to create 
        objects, not just repair them.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I feel the skills required to fix and diagnose vehicle systems are incredibly transferrable
        to the software development industry; first understanding how things work at a macro level,
        and then building upon that theory.</p>

    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>Outside of work and learning to code, I can be found kicking around a soccer ball,
        making music as one half of <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/5RsGqP4ItlgdwYdQcKzjzi">
        dreaming!</a>, and collecting vinyl records.</p>
